# Detecting Botnet Activity Using Machine Learning
## Description

This project aims to detect botnet activity using machine learning techniques. Botnets are a major threat to cybersecurity, and existing network forensic techniques are often unable to identify and track sophisticated botnets. In this project, we will use machine learning to train and validate a model for detecting botnet activity.
